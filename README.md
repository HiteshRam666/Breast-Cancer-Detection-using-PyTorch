# Breast Cancer Detection Neural Network

This repository contains code for training a neural network model using PyTorch on the Breast Cancer dataset for the purpose of detection.

## Dataset
The Breast Cancer dataset used in this project is publicly available and widely used for machine learning experimentation. It consists of features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image and are used to predict whether the mass is malignant or benign.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/breast-cancer-neural-network.git
